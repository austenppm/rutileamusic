I have implemented a Python application which uses the OpenAI API, innertube, tkinter for a gui interface, and webview among many other libraries. 
The program requires several APIs, meaning several API keys. If RUTILEA does not use these APIs or API keys, it would be difficult to run the application from just the Python file. 
The remaining files are some photos that I am going to be using to test my application.
